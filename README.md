# CS319---Information-Office-Web-Application

This project aims to provide some functionalities for information office staff to introduce our school, Bilkent University, to high schools, prospective university students, and their parents.

## Description

This web application will handle the processes taken while introducing Bilkent University, such as campus tours, individual tours, university fairs, and summer tours.

### Main Functionalities of the Application:

1) The application will rearrange the high schools in the given database in order to prioritize certain high schools (high schools with high YKS results and high schools in cities other than Ankara, respectively). This database will be stored on a data page, which will only be visible to the director of the communication office and the coordinator.
2) The application will provide a contact information section for high school counselors and students who want to contact the school regarding the tours or any information.
3) There will be a form for campus tour applications for high school counselors to fill out, which will have a list of high schools to choose from rather than writing the school’s name by hand. In case the school name is not on the list, there will be an option to write the name of the school. Moreover, a multiple-time slot selection chance will be given, as well as the opportunity to see how many applications have been made for a specific time slot to reduce the conflicting application hours.
4) If an advisor has to accept one of the conflicting hour applications, they will be shown the suggested (prior) high school.
5) After accepting the campus tour application, the system will send the high school counselor a confirmation email.
6) An Excel sheet of all applications will be formed, which will be visible to the director of the communication office, the coordinator, and the advisors. The system will automatically create another Excel sheet of only accepted applications for guides to see and enter their names to the tour they would like to claim. This secondary sheet will be available for advisors to edit.
7) There will be a puantaj page to calculate each guide's payroll. This page will automatically get the working hours for tours from the Excel sheet of accepted applications.
8) An individual tour page will be constructed for students to enter their contact information and their major of interest to assign a guide from that or a related major.
9) There will also be an application page for high schools to invite our school to their university fairs by giving their contact information. These applications will be reviewed by the director of the communication office and the coordinator, later to notify the guides through email.
